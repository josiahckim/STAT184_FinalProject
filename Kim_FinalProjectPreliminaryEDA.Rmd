### Guiding Question
Do black students face harsher/more punishment than their white counterparts within the public school system?  


### Become Acquainted with the Data
I found the data on The Civil Rights Project (https://www.civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/). This data is collected and maintained by The Civil Rights Data Collection (https://ocrdata.ed.gov/). Every other year, all public schools are required to submit a reponse to a survey to the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. Here is a peek at the data:


```{r}
# Load necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
# Stage the data
refAndArrest <- read.csv("Referrals and Arrests.csv")
```


```{r}
glimpse(refAndArrest)
```
